Spell Checker in C

The project aims to design and implement an advanced spell checker that utilizes a minimum edit distance algorithm to identify and correct spelling errors in a given sentence.
The spell checker systematically scans each word within the sentence, flagging any words that are potentially incorrect and providing suggestions for their correct spelling.
Once the suggestions are generated, the spell checker replaces the incorrect words with the appropriate corrections, resulting in a fully corrected sentence.

The minimum edit distance algorithm serves as the foundation for the spell checker's correction mechanism.
It quantifies the similarity between two words by calculating the minimum number of operations required to transform one word into another.
The operations considered include inserting a character, deleting a character, and replacing a character.
By leveraging this algorithm, the spell checker provides accurate spelling suggestions based on the most probable correction options for each flagged word.

The spell checker operates in a user-friendly manner, presenting the corrections in a clear and intuitive format.
Users can easily navigate through the suggestions provided and choose the most appropriate correction for each word.
Furthermore, the spell checker offers seamless integration with various text-based applications, ensuring its accessibility and usability in different contexts.
